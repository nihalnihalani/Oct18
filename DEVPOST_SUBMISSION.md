// MediaRecorder API for voice capture
const startRecording = async () => {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
  const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
  
  mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (event) => {
    audioChunksRef.current.push(event.data);
  };
  
  mediaRecorder.onstop = async () => {
    const audioBlob = new Blob(audioChunksRef.current, { type: 'audio/webm' });
    await transcribeAudio(audioBlob);
  };
};
```

**Gallery Management**
```typescript
// Advanced filtering and sorting
const filteredItems = useMemo(() => {
  return galleryItems
    .filter(item => filterType === 'all' || item.type === filterType)
    .sort((a, b) => {
      switch (sortBy) {
        case 'newest': return b.createdAt.getTime() - a.createdAt.getTime();
        case 'oldest': return a.createdAt.getTime() - b.createdAt.getTime();
        case 'type': return a.type.localeCompare(b.type);
        default: return 0;
      }
    });
